  <p style="color:red"> Although, html Doesn't care of space and distance of line but if you use pre tag then it will respect space and line distance.Example bellow:-</p>
  <p style="font-family: Brush Script MT, cursive; font-size:150%;">This is Cursive font-family and font size is 150% </p>
  <p style=font-size:30px>this is 30 px font.</p>
  <pre>
  Deep into that darkness peering,
  
  Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
  
  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals
  
  Ever dared to dream before;
  
  But the silence was unbroken,
  
  And the stillness gave no token,
  
  And the only word there spoken
  
  Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
  
  This I whispered, and an echo
  
  Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
  
  Merely this, and nothing more.</pre>
