  <pre>
  Deep into that darkness peering,
  
  Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
  
  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals
  
  Ever dared to dream before;
  
  But the silence was unbroken,
  
  And the stillness gave no token,
  
  And the only word there spoken
  
  Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
  
  This I whispered, and an echo
  
  Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
  
  Merely this, and nothing more.</pre>
